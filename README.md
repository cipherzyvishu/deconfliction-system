# üöÅ 3D Drone Conflict Detection & Resolution System

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue.svg)![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-evolving-orange.svg)

This repository documents the evolution of a sophisticated system for ensuring UAV (drone) safety in shared airspace. It progresses from a foundational conflict **detection** system to an advanced conflict **detection and resolution** framework.

The core of the project is the use of **Occupied Volume Boxes (OVBs)**‚Äî3D safety buffers around flight paths‚Äîto analyze potential spatial and temporal conflicts between missions.

## The Two Versions

This project is structured into two distinct versions, each representing a significant step in capability.

### Version 1: The Detector üî¨
A foundational, script-based system focused purely on **detecting** potential conflicts. It uses Python with Matplotlib to generate and visualize 3D mission paths and their safety volumes. It is an excellent starting point for understanding the core geometric and temporal problems in drone deconfliction.

- **Focus**: Conflict Detection
- **Technology**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Interface**: Command-line script / Jupyter Notebook with 3D plots

**[‚û°Ô∏è Go to Version 1 README](./version_1_detector/README.md)**
*(**Note**: Update `version_1_detector` to your actual folder name for Version 1)*

### Version 2: The Deconflictor üöÄ
A full-featured, client-server application that not only detects conflicts but also **automatically resolves them**. It introduces a FastAPI backend, a Streamlit web interface, and uses **linear programming** to calculate optimal flight delays to ensure safety. This version is built for scalability and user interaction.

- **Focus**: Conflict Detection & Automated Resolution
- **Technology**: FastAPI, Streamlit, SciPy, R-tree, Plotly
- **Interface**: Interactive Web Dashboard with a RESTful API

**[‚û°Ô∏è Go to Version 2 README](./version_2_deconflictor/README.md)**
*(**Note**: Update `version_2_deconflictor` to your actual folder name for Version 2)*

## Version Comparison at a Glance

| Feature | Version 1: The Detector | Version 2: The Deconflictor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Function** | Detects 3D spatial-temporal conflicts | Detects **and resolves** conflicts |
| **Resolution Method**| N/A (Detection only) | **Linear Programming** to calculate optimal delays |
| **Architecture** | Standalone Python Script / Notebook | Client-Server (FastAPI backend + Streamlit UI) |
| **User Interface** | Matplotlib 3D plots & GIF animations | Interactive Streamlit Web Dashboard |
| **Performance** | Basic pairwise checks | **R-tree spatial indexing** for faster queries |
| **Trajectory Model** | Linear segments | Linear segments + **Bezier curve smoothing** |
| **API** | None | **RESTful API** for programmatic access |
| **Key Dependencies**| `numpy`, `matplotlib` | `fastapi`, `streamlit`, `scipy`, `rtree`, `plotly` |
| **Best For...** | Learning the fundamentals of 3D conflict detection. | Prototyping a complete deconfliction system with a UI. |

## How to Choose

- **To learn the core concepts** of OVB generation and 3D conflict analysis from the ground up, **start with Version 1**.
- **To see a complete, interactive system** with automated resolution and a modern web stack, **explore Version 2**.

## Overall Project Goals

- **Safety**: To provide a reliable framework for preventing mid-air collisions in increasingly crowded airspace.
- **Efficiency**: To resolve conflicts with minimal disruption to original mission plans.
- **Scalability**: To design systems capable of handling a high volume of simultaneous drone traffic.
